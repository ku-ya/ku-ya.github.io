My research interests lie in the field of robotics, especially developing systems relating perception:

- Robot perception
- Multimodal Sensor and information fusion
- Learning from human capability and extending or assisting human perception

My previous research includes

- non-field-of-view target localization and tracking through a probabilistic framework.
- autonomous systems
- Bayesian estimation and control
- Sensor network
- Auditory sensing/ Robot audition
- Mobile robots
