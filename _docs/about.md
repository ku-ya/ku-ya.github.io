{% include base_path %}

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at The George Washington University, where I work within [Flight Dynamics and Control Lab](http://fdcl.seas.gwu.edu/) directed by [Professor Taeyoung Lee](http://fdcl.seas.gwu.edu/faculty.html). The research mainly focuses on multiple unmanned aerial vehicle exploration.

Prior to joining the FDCL, I was in Mechanical Engineering Department at [Computational Multiphysics and Systems Lab](http://www.me.vt.edu/cms/) directed by Professor Tomonari Furukawa.

I received a BS in Biomedical Engineering, and MS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and subsequently a Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. I am currently working in Human-Robot Interaction, applying a probabilistic novel non-field-of-view target estimation approach, which was developed in previous work as a Ph.D student.
