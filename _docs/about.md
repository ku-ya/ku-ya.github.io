{% include base_path %}

I am a postdoctoral researcher in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department at The George Washington University, where I work within [Flight Dynamics and Control Lab](http://fdcl.seas.gwu.edu/) directed by [Professor Taeyoung Lee](http://fdcl.seas.gwu.edu/faculty.html).
The research mainly focuses on corporative unmanned aerial exploration.

Prior to joining FDCL, I was in Mechanical Engineering Department at [Computational Multiphysics and Systems Lab](http://www.me.vt.edu/cms/) directed by Professor Tomonari Furukawa.
I was working in Human-Robot Interaction, applying a probabilistic novel non-field-of-view target estimation approach, which was developed in previous work as a Ph.D student.

I received a BS in [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/bme/), and MS in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/) and subsequently a Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
