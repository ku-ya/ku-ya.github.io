I am a postdoctoral researcher in Mechanical Engineering Department at Virginia Tech, where I work within the Computational Multiphysics and Systems Lab directed by Professor Tomonari Furukawa.

I received a BS in Biomedical Engineering, and MS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and subsequently a Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. I am currently working in Human-Robot Interaction, applying a probabilistic novel non-field-of-view target estimation approach, which was developed in previous work as a Ph.D student.
